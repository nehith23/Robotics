Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) translate changes in brain activity into control signals. BCI serves as a communication tool using brain signals to control external devices, like robots. Brain waves are captured using sensors and analyzed. BCIs facilitate direct communication between the human brain and physical devices by interpreting varying thought patterns. The system monitors human brain waves to guide the robot based on the user's intent. Brain waves are converted into data packets and sent wirelessly. A key advantage of BCI: users can control robots wirelessly using EEG sensors placed on the head. EEG data is transmitted to the robot via Bluetooth, which then guides the robot's actions.
