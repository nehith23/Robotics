Welcome to my Drones Project Repository. This is an early-stage project where I'm focusing on understanding and exploring drone technology, primarily from a programming perspective. I've started by gathering and studying various resources, the details of which are in the .md files uploaded here. These files cover essential topics like drone control algorithms, software for flight mechanics, and programming for drone operations. As I progress, I'll be updating this repository with my findings, code samples, and practical implementations, aiming to develop and refine drone-related software and applications. Keep an eye on this space for regular updates on my journey into drone programming.
