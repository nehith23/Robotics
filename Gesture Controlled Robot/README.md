Welcome to the repository of our comprehensive Gesture-Controlled Surveillance Rover Project. This innovative project seamlessly blends robotics, gesture control, and surveillance technology into a single, multifunctional device. It is divided into three main parts, each contributing to the creation of a sophisticated, gesture-navigated surveillance rover.

Rover Construction: The foundation of this project lies in building a robust rover. We've utilized a standard metal chassis as the base, ensuring durability and adaptability. This section provides detailed instructions on assembling the chassis, setting up the motors, and integrating control mechanisms to create a responsive and sturdy rover, ready for customization and further enhancements.

Gesture Control Glove: The second part of the project introduces an innovative way to control the rover - through hand gestures. This is achieved by constructing a specialized glove fitted with an accelerometer and a flex sensor. Linked to an Arduino board, this glove translates your hand movements into commands, allowing you to navigate the rover with just gestures. The tutorials cover every aspect of building and programming the glove, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.

Surveillance and Streaming Capabilities: The final piece of the project integrates surveillance functionalities into the rover. This involves setting up cameras for live streaming, making the rover not just a tool for exploration but also a powerful surveillance device. This section guides you through connecting the cameras, implementing live streaming capabilities with a Raspberry Pi, and integrating these systems with the rover's control mechanisms.

Throughout this project, we've engaged with various aspects of robotics, from mechanical assembly and electronic circuitry to software programming and IoT applications. It's designed to be an educational journey as much as a functional creation, offering insights into gesture control technology, wireless communication, and real-time surveillance systems.
