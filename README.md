This repository showcases a collection of my robotics projects, each demonstrating unique applications of robotics and automation. The "Gesture Control Robot" project is an innovative venture where a robot is navigated through human gestures(hand gesture glove), merging intuitive human-robot interactions with sophisticated control systems. In the "BCI Based Autonomous Controlled Robot", cutting-edge brain-computer interface technology is harnessed to direct an autonomous robot, reflecting a significant leap in AI and neurotechnology integration. The "Robot Navigation Using Rasp Controller" project demonstrates the use of a Raspberry Pi controller for precise robotic navigation, illustrating the power of compact computing in robotics. Lastly, the "Drone Swarm, Search & Rescue Operation" project features a coordinated group of drones designed for search and rescue missions, showcasing the potential of drone technology in critical, life-saving operations. Each project in this repository represents a step forward in the field of robotics, offering insights into the future of automated systems and their real-world applications.
